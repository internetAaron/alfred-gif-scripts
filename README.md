Overview
-----------

I often enjoy posting animated gifs to express how I'm feeling or during chat conversations with friends but often it takes way to long to find the appropriate gif to express what you're needing.  So I've started a library of Alfred scripts that will copy and past the animated gif url to your clipboard for easy sharing.

Keywords
--------

I've tried to keep the keywords as simple to remember as possible.  When you type in each keyword you will get one or more options that you can use for your given situation.

- bye
- clap
- excited
- mad
- no
- omg
- phone
- wtf
- yes


Installation 
------------

1. Open Alfred preferences.
2. Go to the Extensions tab.
3. Drag .alfredextension files to Scripts section in the side bar.
4. Start gifing!
