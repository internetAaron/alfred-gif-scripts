Overview
-----------

It's been becoming more and more popular to post gifs to twitter but often it takes way to long to find the appropriate gif to express what you're feeling.  So I've started a library of Alfred scripts that will copy and past the animated gif to your clipboard for easy sharing.

Keywords
--------

I've tried to keep the keywords as simple to remember as possible.  When you type in each keyword you will get one or more options that you can use for your given situation.

bye
